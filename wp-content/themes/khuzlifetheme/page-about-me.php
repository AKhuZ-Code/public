        <p>Hello there! I'm Jason and I'm currently a third-year at UNSW.
        </p>
        <p>ðŸ’» I started this blog because I felt that I had alot to share.</p>
        <p>ðŸ“š I have an avid interest in reading books in order to better myself,
            and I hope to share the insights I have gained with those who don't have the time to read.</p>
        <p>ðŸ““ I also reflect on my experience ritualistically, and I hope to leverage that to write content that resonates with people.</p>
